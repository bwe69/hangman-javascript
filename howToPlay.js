There are 3 lifelines.
The vowel lifeline, which shows ALL VOWELS in the word.
The defintiion lifeline, which shows you the DEFINITION of the word.
And the magical pass lifeline! Which allows you to pass the round magically.
Every round, your lifelines will be resetted!
`,
`
When you win or lose the game, your score and time elapsed
will be displayed in the leaderboards.
So, don't take your time, BE SWIFT! BE FAST! AND HAVE A BLAST!
`,
`
BUT AT LAST!
The ultimate goal of the game is to guess all words correctly.
And more importantly, keep MR. Hangman alive!
Good Luck and have fun!
